# Face Recognition using Support Vector Machine

This repo explores application of Support Vector Machines for classificiation purposes. The notebook covers basic concepts of SVM and an exercise in implementing SVM to classify images. Two datasets are used 
* Faces dataset from sci-kit learn data sources. 
* The second is classification of various bit components (in progress)
